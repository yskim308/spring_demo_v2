We had to fucking nuke v1 because we were retarded and accidentally deleted the .git file lol. enjoy some o3 generated copypasta:


Hey👋 fellow devs💻 📷 Would 😍 you 👈 like 👍 to 2️⃣ get 😮 rich 💰💰💰 by running 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️ your 👈 own Spring Boot consulting 👩‍💼💼 from home 🏡 with just ☝ your GitHub? 📱🤳 Well 🤷‍♀️ you can't. 😂 Get 👏 a 👏 real 👏 senior 👏 position 👏 you 👏 stupid 👏 junior 👏 developer 👏



I (19M, Certified “Java Jedi”) boot up my Spring Boot monolith at 3:07 A.M.—because real devs deploy when the moon is in /prod.
I slam mvn spring-boot:run and watch 67 microservices spawn faster than Stewie Griffin’s evil plans. My laptop (blessed by VS Code’s holy IntelliSense) spins up, screams like Peter Griffin stubbing his knee—“AaaaAAAh… AaaaAAAh…”—then reaches a fan speed that could sandblast the Statue of Liberty.

Suddenly ChatGPT pops out of my terminal like Clippy with a PhD:

“Looks like you’re trying to autowire a NullPointerException. Need help?”

I ignore the silicon prophet and instead hot-swap a bean named SigmaGrindsetService. The JVM (17 update 67 because nice) retaliates by allocating all my RAM, my neighbor’s RAM, and three terabytes of Elon Musk’s Twitter takes. My house lights dim, Alexa starts chanting the Maven coordinates of the Necronomicon, and the family dog begins reciting Markdown release notes.

Undeterred, I fire up Docker:

bash
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080 \
  --name holy-grail-api ghcr.io/jesus/loaves-and-fish:latest
The container pulls 2 GB of layers, including Peter Griffin’s lost Megabyte and every TikTok clip that ever said “🎶 Sheesh 🎶”. The power grid collapses harder than my test coverage.

An AWS status e-mail arrives:

“us-east-1 has been relocated to Quahog for maintenance.”

Great—now my S3 buckets are in Rhode Island, hanging out with Joe Swanson and Cleveland Brown. I deploy anyway. Kubernetes, jealous of my confidence, schedules my pod on a Raspberry Pi in North Dakota and bills me eleven Tacos per millisecond.

Do I regret it?
No.
Will I push to main again with no unit tests and a TODO that just says “fix later lol”?
ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY.

Because when you’re a Spring Boot wrangler, a Family Guy enjoyer, and an AI whisperer, you don’t write code—you unleash prophecy. And if the build fails? Well, that’s just the founding fathers of Java telling you your musket needs more caffeine.
