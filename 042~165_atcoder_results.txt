Title: B - Iroha Loves Strings (ABC Edition)

Points: 200

Problem Statement: Iroha has a sequence of N strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_N. The length of each string is L. She will concatenate all of the strings in some order, to produce a long string. Among all strings that she can produce in this way, find the lexicographically smallest one. Here, a string s=s_1s_2s_3...s_n is lexicographically smaller than another string t=t_1t_2t_3...t_m if and only if one of the following holds: There exists an index i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), such that s_j = t_j for all indices j(1≦j<i), and s_i<t_i. s_i = t_i for all integers i(1≦i≦min(n,m)), and n<m.

Title: C - Iroha's Obsession

Points: 300

Problem Statement: Iroha is very particular about numbers. There are K digits that she dislikes: D_1, D_2, ..., D_K. She is shopping, and now paying at the cashier. Her total is N yen (the currency of Japan), thus she has to hand at least N yen to the cashier (and possibly receive the change). However, as mentioned before, she is very particular about numbers. When she hands money to the cashier, the decimal notation of the amount must not contain any digits that she dislikes. Under this condition, she will hand the minimum amount of money. Find the amount of money that she will hand to the cashier.

Title: D - Iroha and a Grid

Points: 400

Problem Statement: We have a large square grid with H rows and W columns. Iroha is now standing in the top-left cell. She will repeat going right or down to the adjacent cell, until she reaches the bottom-right cell. However, she cannot enter the cells in the intersection of the bottom A rows and the leftmost B columns. (That is, there are A×B forbidden cells.) There is no restriction on entering the other cells. Find the number of ways she can travel to the bottom-right cell. Since this number can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7.

Title: B - Unhappy Hacking (ABC Edit)

Points: 200

Problem Statement: Sig has built his own keyboard. Designed for ultimate simplicity, this keyboard only has 3 keys on it: the 0 key, the 1 key and the backspace key. To begin with, he is using a plain text editor with this keyboard. This editor always displays one string (possibly empty). Just after the editor is launched, this string is empty. When each key on the keyboard is pressed, the following changes occur to the string: The 0 key: a letter 0 will be inserted to the right of the string. The 1 key: a letter 1 will be inserted to the right of the string. The backspace key: if the string is empty, nothing happens. Otherwise, the rightmost letter of the string is deleted. Sig has launched the editor, and pressed these keys several times. You are given a string s, which is a record of his keystrokes in order. In this string, the letter 0 stands for the 0 key, the letter 1 stands for the 1 key and the letter B stands for the backspace key. What string is displayed in the editor now?

Title: D - Digit Sum

Points: 500

Problem Statement: For integers b (b \geq 2) and n (n \geq 1), let the function f(b,n) be defined as follows: f(b,n) = n, when n < b f(b,n) = f(b,\,{\rm floor}(n / b)) + (n \ {\rm mod} \ b), when n \geq b Here, {\rm floor}(n / b) denotes the largest integer not exceeding n / b, and n \ {\rm mod} \ b denotes the remainder of n divided by b. Less formally, f(b,n) is equal to the sum of the digits of n written in base b. For example, the following hold: f(10,\,87654)=8+7+6+5+4=30 f(100,\,87654)=8+76+54=138 You are given integers n and s. Determine if there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s. If the answer is positive, also find the smallest such b.

Title: D - AtCoDeer and Rock-Paper

Points: 300

Problem Statement: AtCoDeer the deer and his friend TopCoDeer is playing a game. The game consists of N turns. In each turn, each player plays one of the two gestures, Rock and Paper, as in Rock-paper-scissors, under the following condition: (※) After each turn, (the number of times the player has played Paper)≦(the number of times the player has played Rock). Each player's score is calculated by (the number of turns where the player wins) - (the number of turns where the player loses), where the outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of Rock-paper-scissors. (For those who are not familiar with Rock-paper-scissors: If one player plays Rock and the other plays Paper, the latter player will win and the former player will lose. If both players play the same gesture, the round is a tie and neither player will win nor lose.) With his supernatural power, AtCoDeer was able to foresee the gesture that TopCoDeer will play in each of the N turns, before the game starts. Plan AtCoDeer's gesture in each turn to maximize AtCoDeer's score. The gesture that TopCoDeer will play in each turn is given by a string s. If the i-th (1≦i≦N) character in s is g, TopCoDeer will play Rock in the i-th turn. Similarly, if the i-th (1≦i≦N) character of s in p, TopCoDeer will play Paper in the i-th turn.

Initially, the whole region within the rectangle is painted white. Snuke plotted N points into the rectangle. The coordinate of the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) point was (x_i, y_i). Then, he created an integer sequence a of length N, and for each 1 ≦ i ≦ N, he painted some region within the rectangle black, as follows: If a_i = 1, he painted the region satisfying x < x_i within the rectangle. If a_i = 2, he painted the region satisfying x > x_i within the rectangle. If a_i = 3, he painted the region satisfying y < y_i within the rectangle. If a_i = 4, he painted the region satisfying y > y_i within the rectangle. Find the area of the white region within the rectangle after he finished painting.

Title: C - 1D Reversi

Points: 300

Problem Statement: Two foxes Jiro and Saburo are playing a game called 1D Reversi. This game is played on a board, using black and white stones. On the board, stones are placed in a row, and each player places a new stone to either end of the row. Similarly to the original game of Reversi, when a white stone is placed, all black stones between the new white stone and another white stone, turn into white stones, and vice versa. In the middle of a game, something came up and Saburo has to leave the game. The state of the board at this point is described by a string S. There are |S| (the length of S) stones on the board, and each character in S represents the color of the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ |S|) stone from the left. If the i-th character in S is B, it means that the color of the corresponding stone on the board is black. Similarly, if the i-th character in S is W, it means that the color of the corresponding stone is white. Jiro wants all stones on the board to be of the same color. For this purpose, he will place new stones on the board according to the rules. Find the minimum number of new stones that he needs to place.

Title: D - An Invisible Hand

Points: 400

Problem Statement: There are N towns located in a line, conveniently numbered 1 through N. Takahashi the merchant is going on a travel from town 1 to town N, buying and selling apples. Takahashi will begin the travel at town 1, with no apple in his possession. The actions that can be performed during the travel are as follows: Move: When at town i (i < N), move to town i + 1. Merchandise: Buy or sell an arbitrary number of apples at the current town. Here, it is assumed that one apple can always be bought and sold for A_i yen (the currency of Japan) at town i (1 ≦ i ≦ N), where A_i are distinct integers. Also, you can assume that he has an infinite supply of money. For some reason, there is a constraint on merchandising apple during the travel: the sum of the number of apples bought and the number of apples sold during the whole travel, must be at most T. (Note that a single apple can be counted in both.) During the travel, Takahashi will perform actions so that the profit of the travel is maximized. Here, the profit of the travel is the amount of money that is gained by selling apples, minus the amount of money that is spent on buying apples. Note that we are not interested in apples in his possession at the end of the travel. Aoki, a business rival of Takahashi, wants to trouble Takahashi by manipulating the market price of apples. Prior to the beginning of Takahashi's travel, Aoki can change A_i into another arbitrary non-negative integer A_i' for any town i, any number of times. The cost of performing this operation is |A_i - A_i'|. After performing this operation, different towns may have equal values of A_i. Aoki's objective is to decrease Takahashi's expected profit by at least 1 yen. Find the minimum total cost to achieve it. You may assume that Takahashi's expected profit is initially at least 1 yen.

The animal numbered i (2≤i≤N-1) is adjacent to the animals numbered i-1 and i+1. Also, the animal numbered 1 is adjacent to the animals numbered 2 and N, and the animal numbered N is adjacent to the animals numbered N-1 and 1. There are two kinds of animals in this zoo: honest sheep that only speak the truth, and lying wolves that only tell lies. Snuke cannot tell the difference between these two species, and asked each animal the following question: "Are your neighbors of the same species?" The animal numbered i answered s_i. Here, if s_i is o, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of the same species, and if s_i is x, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of different species. More formally, a sheep answered o if the two neighboring animals are both sheep or both wolves, and answered x otherwise. Similarly, a wolf answered x if the two neighboring animals are both sheep or both wolves, and answered o otherwise. Snuke is wondering whether there is a valid assignment of species to the animals that is consistent with these responses. If there is such an assignment, show one such assignment. Otherwise, print -1.

Title: B - Collecting Balls (Easy Version)

Points: 200

Problem Statement: There are N balls in the xy-plane. The coordinates of the i-th of them is (x_i, i). Thus, we have one ball on each of the N lines y = 1, y = 2, ..., y = N. In order to collect these balls, Snuke prepared 2N robots, N of type A and N of type B. Then, he placed the i-th type-A robot at coordinates (0, i), and the i-th type-B robot at coordinates (K, i). Thus, now we have one type-A robot and one type-B robot on each of the N lines y = 1, y = 2, ..., y = N. When activated, each type of robot will operate as follows. When a type-A robot is activated at coordinates (0, a), it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = a, collect the ball, move back to its original position (0, a) and deactivate itself. If there is no such ball, it will just deactivate itself without doing anything. When a type-B robot is activated at coordinates (K, b), it will move to the position of the ball on the line y = b, collect the ball, move back to its original position (K, b) and deactivate itself. If there is no such ball, it will just deactivate itself without doing anything. Snuke will activate some of the 2N robots to collect all of the balls. Find the minimum possible total distance covered by robots.

Title: C - Sugar Water

Points: 300

Problem Statement: Snuke is making sugar water in a beaker. Initially, the beaker is empty. Snuke can perform the following four types of operations any number of times. He may choose not to perform some types of operations. Operation 1: Pour 100A grams of water into the beaker. Operation 2: Pour 100B grams of water into the beaker. Operation 3: Put C grams of sugar into the beaker. Operation 4: Put D grams of sugar into the beaker. In our experimental environment, E grams of sugar can dissolve into 100 grams of water. Snuke will make sugar water with the highest possible density. The beaker can contain at most F grams of substances (water and sugar combined), and there must not be any undissolved sugar in the beaker. Find the mass of the sugar water Snuke will make, and the mass of sugar dissolved in it. If there is more than one candidate, any of them will be accepted. We remind you that the sugar water that contains a grams of water and b grams of sugar is \frac{100b}{a + b} percent. Also, in this problem, pure water that does not contain any sugar is regarded as 0 percent density sugar water.

Title: D - Restoring Road Network

Points: 500

Problem Statement: In Takahashi Kingdom, which once existed, there are N cities, and some pairs of cities are connected bidirectionally by roads. The following are known about the road network: People traveled between cities only through roads. It was possible to reach any city from any other city, via intermediate cities if necessary. Different roads may have had different lengths, but all the lengths were positive integers. Snuke the archeologist found a table with N rows and N columns, A, in the ruin of Takahashi Kingdom. He thought that it represented the shortest distances between the cities along the roads in the kingdom. Determine whether there exists a road network such that for each u and v, the integer A_{u, v} at the u-th row and v-th column of A is equal to the length of the shortest path from City u to City v. If such a network exist, find the shortest possible total length of the roads.

Problem Statement: A railroad running from west to east in Atcoder Kingdom is now complete. There are N stations on the railroad, numbered 1 through N from west to east. Tomorrow, the opening ceremony of the railroad will take place. On this railroad, for each integer i such that 1≤i≤N-1, there will be trains that run from Station i to Station i+1 in C_i seconds. No other trains will be operated. The first train from Station i to Station i+1 will depart Station i S_i seconds after the ceremony begins. Thereafter, there will be a train that departs Station i every F_i seconds. Here, it is guaranteed that F_i divides S_i. That is, for each Time t satisfying S_i≤t and t％F_i=0, there will be a train that departs Station i t seconds after the ceremony begins and arrives at Station i+1 t+C_i seconds after the ceremony begins, where A％B denotes A modulo B, and there will be no other trains. For each i, find the earliest possible time we can reach Station N if we are at Station i when the ceremony begins, ignoring the time needed to change trains.

Title: D - Two Sequences

Points: 500

Problem Statement: You are given two integer sequences, each of length N: a_1, ..., a_N and b_1, ..., b_N. There are N^2 ways to choose two integers i and j such that 1 \leq i, j \leq N. For each of these N^2 pairs, we will compute a_i + b_j and write it on a sheet of paper. That is, we will write N^2 integers in total. Compute the XOR of these N^2 integers.  Definition of XOR The XOR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m is defined as follows: Let the XOR be X. In the binary representation of X, the digit in the 2^k's place (0 \leq k; k is an integer) is 1 if there are an odd number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representation has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 if that number is even. For example, let us compute the XOR of 3 and 5. The binary representation of 3 is 011, and the binary representation of 5 is 101, thus the XOR has the binary representation 110, that is, the XOR is 6.

Title: A - Something on It

Points: 100

Problem Statement: In "Takahashi-ya", a ramen restaurant, a bowl of ramen costs 700 yen (the currency of Japan), plus 100 yen for each kind of topping (boiled egg, sliced pork, green onions). A customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string S. S is three characters long, and if the first character in S is o, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is x, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen. Write a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.

Problem Statement: Akaki, a patissier, can make N kinds of doughnut using only a certain powder called "Okashi no Moto" (literally "material of pastry", simply called Moto below) as ingredient. These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts. Now, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition: For each of the N kinds of doughnuts, make at least one doughnut of that kind. At most how many doughnuts can be made here? She does not necessarily need to consume all of her Moto. Also, under the constraints of this problem, it is always possible to obey the condition.

Title: D - Static Sushi

Points: 500

Problem Statement: "Teishi-zushi", a Japanese restaurant, is a plain restaurant with only one round counter. The outer circumference of the counter is C meters. Customers cannot go inside the counter. Nakahashi entered Teishi-zushi, and he was guided to the counter. Now, there are N pieces of sushi (vinegared rice with seafood and so on) on the counter. The distance measured clockwise from the point where Nakahashi is standing to the point where the i-th sushi is placed, is x_i meters. Also, the i-th sushi has a nutritive value of v_i kilocalories. Nakahashi can freely walk around the circumference of the counter. When he reach a point where a sushi is placed, he can eat that sushi and take in its nutrition (naturally, the sushi disappears). However, while walking, he consumes 1 kilocalories per meter. Whenever he is satisfied, he can leave the restaurant from any place (he does not have to return to the initial place). On balance, at most how much nutrition can he take in before he leaves? That is, what is the maximum possible value of the total nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed? Assume that there are no other customers, and no new sushi will be added to the counter. Also, since Nakahashi has plenty of nutrition in his body, assume that no matter how much he walks and consumes energy, he never dies from hunger.

Definition of XOR The XOR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m is defined as follows: Let the XOR be X. In the binary representation of X, the digit in the 2^k's place (0 \leq k; k is an integer) is 1 if there are an odd number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representation has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 if that number is even. For example, let us compute the XOR of 3 and 5. The binary representation of 3 is 011, and the binary representation of 5 is 101, thus the XOR has the binary representation 110, that is, the XOR is 6.

We say the grid is a good grid when the following condition is met for all i,j,x,y satisfying 1 \leq i,j,x,y \leq N: If (i+j) \% 3=(x+y) \% 3, the color of (i,j) and the color of (x,y) are the same. If (i+j) \% 3 \neq (x+y) \% 3, the color of (i,j) and the color of (x,y) are different. Here, X \% Y represents X modulo Y. We will repaint zero or more squares so that the grid will be a good grid. For a square, the wrongness when the color of the square is X before repainting and Y after repainting, is D_{X,Y}. Find the minimum possible sum of the wrongness of all the squares.

T_j = B T_k = C For example, when T = ABCBC, there are three triples of integers (i, j, k) that satisfy the conditions: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 5), (1, 4, 5). Thus, the ABC number of T is 3. You are given a string S. Each character of S is A, B, C or ?. Let Q be the number of occurrences of ? in S. We can make 3^Q strings by replacing each occurrence of ? in S with A, B or C. Find the sum of the ABC numbers of all these strings. This sum can be extremely large, so print the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

The sections are numbered 1, 2, ..., m, and the joints are numbered 0, 1, ..., m. Section i connects Joint i-1 and Joint i. The length of Section i is d_i. For each section, its mode can be specified individually. There are four modes: L, R, D and U. The mode of a section decides the direction of that section. If we consider the factory as a coordinate plane, the position of Joint i will be determined as follows (we denote its coordinates as (x_i, y_i)): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0). If the mode of Section i is L, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} - d_{i}, y_{i-1}). If the mode of Section i is R, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} + d_{i}, y_{i-1}). If the mode of Section i is D, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} - d_{i}). If the mode of Section i is U, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1} + d_{i}). Snuke would like to introduce a robot arm so that the position of Joint m can be matched with all of the N points (X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), ..., (X_N, Y_N) by properly specifying the modes of the sections. Is this possible? If so, find such a robot arm and how to bring Joint m to each point (X_j, Y_j).

Title: F - Engines

Points: 600

Problem Statement: E869120 is initially standing at the origin (0, 0) in a two-dimensional plane. He has N engines, which can be used as follows: When E869120 uses the i-th engine, his X- and Y-coordinate change by x_i and y_i, respectively. In other words, if E869120 uses the i-th engine from coordinates (X, Y), he will move to the coordinates (X + x_i, Y + y_i). E869120 can use these engines in any order, but each engine can be used at most once. He may also choose not to use some of the engines. He wants to go as far as possible from the origin. Let (X, Y) be his final coordinates. Find the maximum possible value of \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}, the distance from the origin.

The i-th passage connects Room s_i and Room t_i (s_i < t_i) and can only be traversed in the direction from Room s_i to Room t_i. It is known that, for each room except Room N, there is at least one passage going from that room. Takahashi will escape from the cave. Each time he reaches a room (assume that he has reached Room 1 at the beginning), he will choose a passage uniformly at random from the ones going from that room and take that passage. Aoki, a friend of Takahashi's, can block one of the passages (or do nothing) before Takahashi leaves Room 1. However, it is not allowed to block a passage so that Takahashi is potentially unable to reach Room N. Let E be the expected number of passages Takahashi takes before he reaches Room N. Find the value of E when Aoki makes a choice that minimizes E.

Title: E - Balanced Path

Points: 500

Problem Statement: We have a grid with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. The square (i, j) has two numbers A_{ij} and B_{ij} written on it. First, for each square, Takahashi paints one of the written numbers red and the other blue. Then, he travels from the square (1, 1) to the square (H, W). In one move, he can move from a square (i, j) to the square (i+1, j) or the square (i, j+1). He must not leave the grid. Let the unbalancedness be the absolute difference of the sum of red numbers and the sum of blue numbers written on the squares along Takahashi's path, including the squares (1, 1) and (H, W). Takahashi wants to make the unbalancedness as small as possible by appropriately painting the grid and traveling on it. Find the minimum unbalancedness possible.

Title: D - Prediction and Restriction

Points: 400

Problem Statement: At an arcade, Takahashi is playing a game called RPS Battle, which is played as follows: The player plays N rounds of Rock Paper Scissors against the machine. (See Notes for the description of Rock Paper Scissors. A draw also counts as a round.) Each time the player wins a round, depending on which hand he/she uses, he/she earns the following score (no points for a draw or a loss): R points for winning with Rock; S points for winning with Scissors; P points for winning with Paper. However, in the i-th round, the player cannot use the hand he/she used in the (i-K)-th round. (In the first K rounds, the player can use any hand.) Before the start of the game, the machine decides the hand it will play in each round. With supernatural power, Takahashi managed to read all of those hands. The information Takahashi obtained is given as a string T. If the i-th character of T (1 \leq i \leq N) is r, the machine will play Rock in the i-th round. Similarly, p and s stand for Paper and Scissors, respectively. What is the maximum total score earned in the game by adequately choosing the hand to play in each round?

Problem Statement: Takahashi has come to a party as a special guest. There are N ordinary guests at the party. The i-th ordinary guest has a power of A_i. Takahashi has decided to perform M handshakes to increase the happiness of the party (let the current happiness be 0). A handshake will be performed as follows: Takahashi chooses one (ordinary) guest x for his left hand and another guest y for his right hand (x and y can be the same). Then, he shakes the left hand of Guest x and the right hand of Guest y simultaneously to increase the happiness by A_x+A_y. However, Takahashi should not perform the same handshake more than once. Formally, the following condition must hold: Assume that, in the k-th handshake, Takahashi shakes the left hand of Guest x_k and the right hand of Guest y_k. Then, there is no pair p, q (1 \leq p < q \leq M) such that (x_p,y_p)=(x_q,y_q). What is the maximum possible happiness after M handshakes?

Title: F - Removing Robots

Points: 600

Problem Statement: There are N robots numbered 1 to N placed on a number line. Robot i is placed at coordinate X_i. When activated, it will travel the distance of D_i in the positive direction, and then it will be removed from the number line. All the robots move at the same speed, and their sizes are ignorable. Takahashi, who is a mischievous boy, can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero) as long as there is a robot remaining on the number line. Choose a robot and activate it. This operation cannot be done when there is a robot moving. While Robot i is moving, if it touches another robot j that is remaining in the range [X_i, X_i + D_i) on the number line, Robot j also gets activated and starts moving. This process is repeated recursively. How many possible sets of robots remaining on the number line are there after Takahashi does the operation some number of times? Compute this count modulo 998244353, since it can be enormous.

Title: E - Rotation Matching

Points: 500

Problem Statement: You are going to hold a competition of one-to-one game called AtCoder Janken. (Janken is the Japanese name for Rock-paper-scissors.) N players will participate in this competition, and they are given distinct integers from 1 through N. The arena has M playing fields for two players. You need to assign each playing field two distinct integers between 1 and N (inclusive). You cannot assign the same integer to multiple playing fields. The competition consists of N rounds, each of which proceeds as follows: For each player, if there is a playing field that is assigned the player's integer, the player goes to that field and fight the other player who comes there. Then, each player adds 1 to its integer. If it becomes N+1, change it to 1. You want to ensure that no player fights the same opponent more than once during the N rounds. Print an assignment of integers to the playing fields satisfying this condition. It can be proved that such an assignment always exists under the constraints given.
